Title: The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth, Volume 5 (of 8)

I love to hear that eloquent old Man Pour forth his meditations, and descant On human life from infancy to age. How pure his spirit! in what vivid hues His mind gives back the various forms of things, Caught in their fairest, happiest, attitude! While he is speaking, I have power to see Even as he sees; but when his voice hath ceased, Then, with a sigh, sometimes I feel, as now, That combinations so serene and bright Cannot be lasting in a world like ours, Whose highest beauty, beautiful as it is, Like that reflected in yon quiet pool, Seems but a fleeting sun-beam's gift, whose peace The sufferance only of a breath of air!
