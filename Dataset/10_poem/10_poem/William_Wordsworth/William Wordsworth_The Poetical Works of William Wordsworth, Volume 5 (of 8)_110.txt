Yet, by the good Knight's leave, the two estates Are graced with some resemblance. Errant those, Exiles and wanderers--and the like are these; Who, with their burthen, traverse hill and dale, Carrying relief for nature's simple wants. --What though no higher recompense be sought Than honest maintenance, by irksome toil Full oft procured, yet may they claim respect, Among the intelligent, for what this course Enables them to be and to perform. Their tardy steps give leisure to observe, While solitude permits the mind to feel; Instructs, and prompts her to supply defects By the division of her inward self For grateful converse: and to these poor men Nature (I but repeat your favourite boast) Is bountiful--go wheresoe'er they may; Kind nature's various wealth is all their own. Versed in the characters of men; and bound, By ties of daily interest, to maintain Conciliatory manners and smooth speech; Such have been, and still are in their degree, Examples efficacious to refine Rude intercourse; apt agents to expel, By importation of unlooked-for arts, Barbarian torpor, and blind prejudice; Raising, through just gradation, savage life To rustic, and the rustic to urbane. --Within their moving magazines is lodged Power that comes forth to quicken and exalt Affections seated in the mother's breast, And in the lover's fancy; and to feed The sober sympathies of long-tried friends. --By these Itinerants, as experienced men, Counsel is given; contention they appease With gentle language; in remotest wilds, Tears wipe away, and pleasant tidings bring; Could the proud quest of chivalry do more?
