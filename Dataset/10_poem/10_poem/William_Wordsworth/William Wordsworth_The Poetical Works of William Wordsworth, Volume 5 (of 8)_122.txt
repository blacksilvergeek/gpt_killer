--Upon this hint We rose together: all were pleased; but most The beauteous girl, whose cheek was flushed with joy. Light as a sunbeam glides along the hills She vanished--eager to impart the scheme To her loved brother and his shy compeer. --Now was there bustle in the Vicar's house And earnest preparation.--Forth we went, And down the vale along the streamlet's edge Pursued our way, a broken company, Mute or conversing, single or in pairs. Thus having reached a bridge, that overarched The hasty rivulet where it lay becalmed In a deep pool, by happy chance we saw A two-fold image; on a grassy bank A snow-white ram, and in the crystal flood Another and the same! Most beautiful, On the green turf, with his imperial front Shaggy and bold, and wreath√®d horns superb, The breathing creature stood; as beautiful, Beneath him, shewed his shadowy counterpart. Each had his glowing mountains, each his sky, And each seemed centre of his own fair world: Antipodes unconscious of each other, Yet, in partition, with their several spheres, Blended in perfect stillness, to our sight!
