I knew from his deportment, mien, and dress, That it could be no other; a pale face, A meagre person, tall, and in a garb Not rustic--dull and faded like himself! He saw us not, though distant but few steps; For he was busy, dealing, from a store Upon a broad leaf carried, choicest strings Of red ripe currants; gift by which he strove, With intermixture of endearing words, To soothe a Child, who walked beside him, weeping As if disconsolate.--
