'Tis well you speak At a safe distance from our native land, And from the mansions where our youth was taught. The true descendants of those godly men Who swept from Scotland, in a flame of zeal, Shrine, altar, image, and the massy piles That harboured them,--the souls retaining yet The churlish features of that after-race Who fled to woods, caverns, and jutting rocks, In deadly scorn of superstitious rites, Or what their scruples construed to be such-- How, think you, would they tolerate this scheme Of fine propensities, that tends, if urged Far as it might be urged, to sow afresh The weeds of Romish phantasy, in vain Uprooted; would re-consecrate our wells To good Saint Fillan and to fair Saint Anne; And from long banishment recal Saint Giles, To watch again with tutelary love O'er stately Edinborough throned on crags? A blessed restoration, to behold The patron, on the shoulders of his priests, Once more parading through her crowded streets Now simply guarded by the sober powers Of science, and philosophy, and sense!
