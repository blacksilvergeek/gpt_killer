Seven years of occupation undisturbed Established seemingly a right to hold That happiness; and use and habit gave To what an alien spirit had acquired A patrimonial sanctity. And thus, With thoughts and wishes bounded to this world, I lived and breathed; most grateful--if to enjoy Without repining or desire for more, For different lot, or change to higher sphere, (Only except some impulses of pride With no determined object, though upheld By theories with suitable support)-- Most grateful, if in such wise to enjoy Be proof of gratitude for what we have; Else, I allow, most thankless.--But, at once, From some dark seat of fatal power was urged A claim that shattered all.--Our blooming girl, Caught in the gripe of death, with such brief time To struggle in as scarcely would allow Her cheek to change its colour, was conveyed From us to inaccessible worlds, to regions Where height, or depth, admits not the approach Of living man, though longing to pursue. --With even as brief a warning--and how soon, With what short interval of time between, I tremble yet to think of--our last prop, Our happy life's only remaining stay-- The brother followed; and was seen no more!
