Upon the breast of new-created earth Man walked; and when and wheresoe'er he moved, Alone or mated, solitude was not. He heard, borne on the wind, the articulate voice Of God; and Angels to his sight appeared Crowning the glorious hills of paradise; Or through the groves gliding like morning mist Enkindled by the sun. He sate--and talked With winged Messengers; who daily brought To his small island in the ethereal deep Tidings of joy and love.--From those pure heights (Whether of actual vision, sensible To sight and feeling, or that in this sort Have condescendingly been shadowed forth Communications spiritually maintained, And intuitions moral and divine) Fell Human-kind--to banishment condemned That flowing years repealed not: and distress And grief spread wide; but Man escaped the doom Of destitution;--solitude was not. --Jehovah--shapeless Power above all Powers, Single and one, the omnipresent God, By vocal utterance, or blaze of light, Or cloud of darkness, localised in heaven; On earth, enshrined within the wandering ark; Or, out of Sion, thundering from his throne Between the Cherubim--on the chosen Race Showered miracles, and ceased not to dispense Judgments, that filled the land from age to age With hope, and love, and gratitude, and fear; And with amazement smote;--thereby to assert His scorned, or unacknowledged, sovereignty. And when the One, ineffable of name, Of nature indivisible, withdrew From mortal adoration or regard, Not then was Deity engulfed; nor Man, The rational creature, left, to feel the weight Of his own reason, without sense or thought Of higher reason and a purer will, To benefit and bless, through mightier power:-- Whether the Persian--zealous to reject Altar and image, and the inclusive walls And roofs of temples built by human hands-- To loftiest heights ascending, from their tops, With myrtle-wreathed tiara on his brow, Presented sacrifice to moon and stars, And to the winds and mother elements, And the whole circle of the heavens, for him A sensitive existence, and a God, With lifted hands invoked, and songs of praise: Or, less reluctantly to bonds of sense Yielding his soul, the Babylonian framed For influence undefined a personal shape; And, from the plain, with toil immense, upreared Tower eight times planted on the top of tower, That Belus, nightly to his splendid couch Descending, there might rest; upon that height Pure and serene, diffused--to overlook Winding Euphrates, and the city vast Of his devoted worshippers, far-stretched, With grove and field and garden interspersed; Their town, and foodful region for support Against the pressure of beleaguering war
