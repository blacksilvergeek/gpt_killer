A thousand visions of a thousand things, And shows, still whimpering thro' threescore of years, The maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers. And art thou not their prince, harmonious Bowles! Thou first, great oracle of tender souls? Whether them sing'st with equal ease, and grief, The fall of empires, or a yellow leaf; Whether thy muse most lamentably tells What merry sounds proceed from Oxford bells, Or, still in bells delighting, finds a friend In every chime that jingled from Ostend; Ah! how much juster were thy Muse's hap, If to thy bells thou would'st but add a cap! Delightful BOWLES! still blessing and still blest, All love thy strain, but children like it best. 'Tis thine, with gentle LITTLE'S moral song, To soothe the mania of the amorous throng! With thee our nursery damsels shed their tears, Ere Miss as yet completes her infant years: But in her teens thy whining powers are vain; She quits poor BOWLES for LITTLE'S purer strain. Now to soft themes thou scornest to confine The lofty numbers of a harp like thine;
