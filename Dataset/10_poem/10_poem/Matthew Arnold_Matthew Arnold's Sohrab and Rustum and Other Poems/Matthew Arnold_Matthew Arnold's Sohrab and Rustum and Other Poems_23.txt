Title: Matthew Arnold's Sohrab and Rustum and Other Poems

For 'tis so, surely! Even in Greece, Where best the poet framed his piece, Even in that Phoebus-guarded ground° °Pausanias° on his travels found °Good poems, if he look'd, more rare (Though many) than good statues were-- For these, in truth, were everywhere. Of bards full many a stroke divine In Dante's,° Petrarch's,° Tasso's° line, °The land of Ariosto° show'd; °And yet, e'en there, the canvas glow'd With triumphs, a yet ampler brood, Of Raphael° and his brotherhood. °And nobly perfect, in our day Of haste, half-work, and disarray, Profound yet touching, sweet yet strong, Hath risen Goethe's,° Wordsworth's° song; °Yet even I (and none will bow Deeper to these) must needs allow, They yield us not, to soothe our pains, Such multitude of heavenly strains As from the kings of sound are blown, Mozart,° Beethoven,° Mendelssohn.°
