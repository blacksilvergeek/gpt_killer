Title: Matthew Arnold's Sohrab and Rustum and Other Poems

Desire not that, my father! thou must live. For some are born to do great deeds, and live, As some are born to be obscured, and die. Do thou the deeds I die too young to do, And reap a second glory in thine age; Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine. But come! thou seest this great host of men Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these! Let me entreat for them; what have they done? They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star. Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace. But me thou must bear hence, not send with them, But carry me with thee to Seistan, And place me on a bed, and mourn for me, Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends. And thou must lay me in that lovely earth, And heap a stately mound° above my bones, °And plant a far-seen pillar over all. That so the passing horseman on the waste May see my tomb a great way off, and cry: _Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there, Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!_ And I be not forgotten in my grave
