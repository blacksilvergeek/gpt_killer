Title: Legends and Lyrics: First Series

The bond that links our souls together; Will it last through stormy weather? Will it moulder and decay As the long hours pass away? Will it stretch if Fate divide us, When dark and weary hours have tried us? Oh, if it look too poor and slight Let us break the links to-night!
