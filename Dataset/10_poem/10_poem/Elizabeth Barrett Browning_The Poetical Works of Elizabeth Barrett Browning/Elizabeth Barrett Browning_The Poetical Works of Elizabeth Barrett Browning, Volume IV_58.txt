Title: The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume IV

Ay, it is He, Who rides at the King's right hand! Leave room to his horse and draw to the side, Nor press too near in the ecstasy Of a newly delivered impassioned land: He is moved, you see, He who has done it all. They call it a cold stern face; But this is Italy Who rises up to her place!-- For this he fought in his youth, Of this he dreamed in the past; The lines of the resolute mouth Tremble a little at last. Cry, he has done it all! "Emperor Evermore."
