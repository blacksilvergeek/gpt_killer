Title: The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume IV

Shout for France and Savoy! Shout for the helper and doer. Shout for the good sword's ring, Shout for the thought still truer. Shout for the spirits at large Who passed for the dead this spring, Whose living glory is sure. Shout for France and Savoy! Shout for the council and charge! Shout for the head of Cavour; And shout for the heart of a King That's great with a nation's joy! Shout for France and Savoy!
