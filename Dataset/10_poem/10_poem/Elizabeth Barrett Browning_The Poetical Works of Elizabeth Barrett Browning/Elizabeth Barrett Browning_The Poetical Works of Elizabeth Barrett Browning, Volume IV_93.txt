Title: The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume IV

Giulio, my Giulio!--sing they so, And you be silent? Do I speak, And you not hear? An arm you throw Round someone, and I feel so weak? --Oh, owl-like birds! They sing for spite, They sing for hate, they sing for doom, They'll sing through death who sing through night, They'll sing and stun me in the tomb-- The nightingales, the nightingales!
