Title: The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume IV

What! did any maintain That God or the people (think!) Could make a marvel in vain?-- Out of the water-jar there, Draw wine that none could drink? Is this a man like the rest, This miracle, made unaware By a rapture of popular air, And caught to the place that was best? You think he could barter and cheat As vulgar diplomates use, With the people's heart in his breast? Prate a lie into shape Lest truth should cumber the road; Play at the fast and loose Till the world is strangled with tape; Maim the soul's complete To fit the hole of a toad; And filch the dogman's meat To feed the offspring of God?
