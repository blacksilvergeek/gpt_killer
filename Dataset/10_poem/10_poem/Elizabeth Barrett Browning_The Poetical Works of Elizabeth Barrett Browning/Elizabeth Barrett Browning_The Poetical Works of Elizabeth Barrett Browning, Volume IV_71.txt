You'll take back your Grand-duke? Observe, there's no one to force it,-- Unless the Madonna, Saint Luke Drew for you, choose to endorse it. _I_ charge you, by great Saint Martino And prodigies quickened by wrong, Remember your Dead on Ticino; Be worthy, be constant, be strong-- Bah!--call back the Grand-duke!!
