Pray take back your Grand-duke. --I, too, have suffered persuasion. All Europe, raven and rook, Screeched at me armed for your nation. Your cause in my heart struck spurs; I swept such warnings aside for you: My very child's eyes, and Hers, Grew like my brother's who died for you. You'll call back the Grand-duke?
