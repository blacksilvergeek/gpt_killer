class HybridEdgeVariantGF(nn.Module):
    """
    HybridEdgeVariantGF Creates a (linear) layer that applies a hybrid 
        edge-variant graph filter using the masking approach.

    Initialization:

        HybridEdgeVariantGF(in_features, out_features, shift_taps,
                            selected_nodes, number_nodes, 
                            edge_features=1, bias=True)

        Inputs:
            in_features (int): number of input features (each feature is a graph
                signal)
            out_features (int): number of output features (each feature is a
                graph signal)
            shift_taps (int): number of shifts to consider
            selected_nodes (int): number of selected nodes to implement the EV
                part of the filter
            number_nodes (int): number of nodes
            edge_features (int): number of features over each edge
            bias (bool): add bias vector (one bias per feature) after graph
                filtering

        Output:
            torch.nn.Module for a graph filtering layer using hybrid 
                edge-variant graph filters.

        Observation: Filter taps have shape
            out_features x edge_features x shift_taps x in_features 
                x number_nodes x number_nodes
            These weights are masked by the corresponding sparsity pattern of
            the graph and the desired number of selected nodes, so only weights
            in the nonzero edges of these nodes will be trained, the
            rest of the parameters contain trash. Therefore, the number of 
            parameters will not reflect the actual number of parameters being
            trained.

    Add graph shift operator:

        HybridEdgeVariantGF.addGSO(GSO) Before applying the filter, we need to
        define the GSO that we are going to use. This allows to change the GSO
        while using the same filtering coefficients (as long as the number of
        edge features is the same; but the number of nodes can change).

        Inputs:
            GSO (torch.tensor): graph shift operator; shape:
                edge_features x number_nodes x number_nodes

    Forward call:

        y = HybridEdgeVariantGF(x)

        Inputs:
            x (torch.tensor): input data; shape:
                batch_size x in_features x number_nodes

        Outputs:
            y (torch.tensor): output; shape:
                batch_size x out_features x number_nodes
